# HFDIncidentsWebMVC
This project is a web application for visualizing both current (active) and past incident data from the Houston Fire Department using Google Maps.

The HFD Active Incidents map displays open calls for the Houston Fire Department. It uses the latitude and longitude of each incident (included in each call when it is opened by HFD) to plot its location on the map.

By selecting an incident marker, you can view details about each incident (e.g. incident type, date and time call was opened, number of units dispatched, types of units on scene). The Active Incidents map also displays real-time traffic data from Google.

The Archive Search page allows you to search the historical incident data. You can search by date and/or incident type.
